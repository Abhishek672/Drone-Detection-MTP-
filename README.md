This Repository contains the work done so far in Drone Detection(MTP).
It includes the diferent .py modules which are coded from scratch to initialize the setup for training.
It includes the .ipynb notebooks which are used for datavisualization, bounding box augmentation, demo runs, training runs etc.
Out of 9 training runs (which includes different train data, different images (RGB+Grayscale+YCbCr)) results of one training run are below:
